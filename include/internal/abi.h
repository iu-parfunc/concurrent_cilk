/**
 * The worker struct contains per-worker information that needs to be
 * visible to the compiler, or rooted here.
 *
 * For 32-bit Windows we need to be aligning the structures on 4-byte
 * boundaries to match where ICL is allocating the birthrank and rank
 * in the __cilkrts_stack_frame.  It's 4-byte aligned instead of 8-byte
 * aligned.  This is OK because the compiler is dealing with the 64-bit
 * quantities as two 32-bit values.  So change the packing to be on
 * 4-byte boundaries.
 *
 * The fields of the worker struct can be classified as either local
 * or shared.
 *
 *  Local: This field is only accessed by the thread bound to this
 *    worker struct.  Local fields can be freely accessed without
 *    acquiring locks.
 *  
 *  Shared: This field may be accessed by multiple worker threads.
 *    Accesses to shared fields usually requires locks, except in
 *    special situations where one can prove that locks are
 *    unnecessary.
 *
 * The fields of the worker struct can also be classified as
 * "read-only" if the field does not change after it is initialized.
 * Otherwise, the field is "read/write".  Read-only fields do not
 * require locks to access (ignoring the synchronization that might be
 * needed for initialization if this can occur in parallel).
 *
 * Finally, we explicitly classify some fields as "synchronization"
 * fields if they are used as part of a synchronization protocol in
 * the runtime.  These variables are generally shared and read/write.
 * Mostly, this category includes lock variables and other variables
 * that are involved in synchronization protocols (i.e., the THE
 * protocol).
