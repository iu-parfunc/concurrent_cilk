/* C++ Interface
 *
 * Purpose: Reducer hyperobject to compute bitwise AND values
 *          When bool is passed as 'Type', it computes logical AND
 *          operation.
 *
 * Classes: reducer_opand<Type>
 *
 * Description:
 * ============
 * This component provides a reducer-type hyperobject representation
 * that allows conducting bitwise AND operation to a non-local variable 
 * using the &=, & operators.  A common operation 
 * when traversing a data structure is to bit-wise AND values 
 * into a non-local numeric variable.  When Cilk parallelism is 
 * introduced, however, a data race will occur on the variable holding 
 * the bit-wise AND result.  By replacing the variable with the
 * hyperobject defined in this component, the data race is eliminated.
 *
 * When bool is passed as the 'Type', this reducer conducts logic AND 
 * operation.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ==============
 * Assume we wish to traverse an array of objects, performing a bit-wise AND
 * operation on each object and accumulating the result of the operation 
 * into an integer variable.
 *..
 *  unsigned int compute(const X& v);
 *
 *  int test()
 *  {
 *      const std::size_t ARRAY_SIZE = 1000000;
 *      extern X myArray[ARRAY_SIZE];
 *      // ...
 *
 *      unsigned int result;
 *      for (std::size_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i)
 *      {
 *          result &= compute(myArray[i]);
 *      }
 *
 *      std::cout << "The result is: " << result << std::endl;
 *
 *      return 0;
 *  }
 *..
 * Changing the 'for' to a 'cilk_for' will cause the loop to run in parallel,
 * but doing so will create a data race on the 'result' variable.
 * The race is solved by changing 'result' to a 'reducer_opand' hyperobject:
 *..
 *  unsigned int compute(const X& v);
 *  
 *   
 *  int test()
 *  {
 *      const std::size_t ARRAY_SIZE = 1000000;
 *      extern X myArray[ARRAY_SIZE];
 *      // ...
 *       
 *      cilk::reducer_opand<unsigned int> result;
 *      cilk_for (std::size_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i)
 *      {
 *          result &= compute(myArray[i]);
 *      }
 *
 *      std::cout << "The result is: " 
 *                << result.get_value() << std::endl;
 *
 *      return 0;
 *  }
 *  
 *
 * Operations provided:
 * ====================
 * Given 'reducer_opand' objects, x and y, the following are
 * valid statements:
 *..
 *  x &= 5;
 *  x = x & 5;
 *..
 * The following are not valid expressions and will result in a run-time error
 * in a debug build:
 *..
 *  x = y;     // Cannot assign one reducer to another
 *  x = y & 5; // Mixed reducers
 *  x = 5 & x; // operator& is not necessarily commutative
 *..
 *..
 *
 * Requirements on the 'Type' parameter
 * ====================================
 * The 'Type' parameter used to instantiate the 'reducer_opand' class must
 * provide a &= operator that meets the requirements for an
 * *associative* *mutating* *operator* as defined in the Cilk++ user manual.
 * The identity function of 'Type' in class Monoid must yield a bit-wise 
 * AND identity, i.e.,
 * a value (such as true in bool) that, when AND with any other value, yields
 * the other value.  
 * 
 * When unsigned int or bool is passed as 'Type', the identity function of 
 * Monoid returns AND identity.
